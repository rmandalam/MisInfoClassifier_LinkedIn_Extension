# Misinformation Classifier Browser Extension for LinkedIn
Web Browser Extension for LinkedIn that allows users to highlight &amp; report posts or comments as "Misinformation" to the original poster.

Rapidly Evolving Misinformation & Scams

Challenge: Misinformation around health, benefits, or relief funds floods social channels—nonprofits struggle to correct rumors in real time.

Alignment with Entertainment / Media Track

Interactive & Shareable: Extension isn’t just lecture—by letting users post rich, branded corrections directly as threaded replies or Stories, it transforms each fact-check into a micro-media campaign.


Storytelling Hooks: You can embed micro-narratives in each correction card (e.g. “Meet Rosa, who almost lost $500 to this scam…”), then the extension templates the graphic.


Viral Potential: Social APIs + shareable badges (“I’m a Fact-Check First Responder”) turn your nonprofit’s staff into visible media ambassadors.
